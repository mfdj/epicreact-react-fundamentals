**Exercises**
 
1. Welcome [#1](https://github.com/mfdj/epicreact-react-fundamentals/pulls/3) adds some personal prefrence config
  * `npm run setup` [1c636ff](https://github.com/mfdj/epicreact-react-fundamentals/commit/1c636ff7bbe3a113d00cf98e4d404a191b52f759)
  * `npm test` works
1. Basic JS "Hello World" [#2](https://github.com/mfdj/epicreact-react-fundamentals/pulls/2)
  * my solution was pure js, whereas the final version used the root element directly in the html
  * learned that there is a [**module**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-type) type for script tags `<script type="module">â€¦</script>` which does neat stuff like scope isolation for inline scripts (see: `extracurricular/script-type-node.html`)
